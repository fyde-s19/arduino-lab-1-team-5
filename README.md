Answers to lab questions:

a. Embedded systems need a setup and a loop so they can initialize the program the embedded system is running and continue running the program.
b. The code needs to be compiled so it is in a form the machine can read.
c. When the frequency is low, your eye can tell that the LED is rapidly turning on and off instead of changing its brightness. A solution to this problem is to use a frequency high enough that your eye cannot tll the difference between a dimming light and a PWM controlled LED.
